## 4. Designing the Simulator Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

1. **Frontend:** User interface for inputting gear, talents, traits, and viewing DPS results.
2. **Backend:** Handles data processing, DPS calculations, and manages import/export functionalities.
3. **Database:** Stores user configurations, data models, and possibly historical simulation data.
4. **API Layer:** Facilitates communication between frontend and backend.

### Detailed Components

#### Frontend

- **Input Forms:** For users to input gear, select talents, and choose traits.
- **DPS Display:** Visual representation of calculated DPS.
- **Import/Export Controls:** Buttons or fields for handling configuration strings.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures usability across devices.

#### Backend

- **Calculation Engine:** Core logic that processes inputs and computes DPS.
- **API Endpoints:**
  - **/simulate:** Accepts user data and returns DPS results.
  - **/import:** Processes import strings into usable data.
  - **/export:** Generates import strings from user data.
- **Data Management:** Handles retrieval and storage of necessary game data.

#### Database

- **Schema Design:**
  - **Users (optional):** If user accounts are needed.
  - **Configurations:** Stores gear, talents, and traits configurations.
  - **Game Data:** Static data related to gear, talents, traits, etc.

## 5. Implementing Import/Export Functionality

### Data Serialization

- **Format Selection:** JSON is human-readable and widely supported, but if the community prefers a compact string format, consider Base64 or a custom encoding scheme.
- **Structure:** Define a consistent structure that encapsulates gear, talents, and traits.

### Import Functionality

1. **Input Parsing:** Accept a string or file containing the configuration data.
2. **Validation:** Ensure the data is valid and corresponds to existing game elements.
3. **Data Mapping:** Translate the imported data into the simulator's internal format.
4. **Error Handling:** Provide meaningful feedback if the import fails.

### Export Functionality

1. **Data Extraction:** Collect the current configuration from the simulator.
2. **Serialization:** Convert the data into the chosen format.
3. **Download/Copy Mechanism:** Allow users to download the string or copy it to the clipboard.
4. **Security Considerations:** Ensure that exported data does not expose sensitive information.

### Libraries and Tools

- **Serialization:** Use libraries like `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse` for JSON handling.
- **Compression (optional):** To shorten import/export strings, consider compressing the data using libraries like `lz-string`.

## 6. Developing the Frontend

### User Interface Design

- **Wireframing:** Create wireframes to outline the layout and user flow.
- **UI/UX Principles:** Ensure the interface is intuitive, accessible, and responsive.

### Key Components

1. **Header:** Project title, navigation links.
2. **Configuration Panel:**
   - **Gear Input:** Dropdowns, sliders, or selection grids for gear pieces.
   - **Talent Selector:** Tree view or multi-select for talents.
   - **Trait Selector:** Checkboxes or similar controls for traits.
3. **Simulation Controls:**
   - **Simulate Button:** Initiates the DPS calculation.
   - **Import/Export Buttons:** For handling configuration strings.
4. **Results Display:**
   - **DPS Output:** Numerical display and possibly graphical representations (charts, graphs).
   - **Detailed Breakdown:** Optionally show how each component contributes to DPS.
5. **Footer:** Additional links, credits, etc.
